            Wine is the primary method for running Windows apps on Zorin OS.
            You can use PlayOnLinux to manage Wine installations more easily.
            For games, Proton through Steam is the best option.
            If you need a commercial solution with better support, you can try CrossOver.
            These steps should allow you to run a wide range of Windows applications and games on Zorin OS!
